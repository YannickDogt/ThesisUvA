Building better communication: An explorative research into system improvements for Dutch public-private construction projects

Author: Yannick Dogterom, University of Amsterdam,  submitted in partial fulfillment for the degree of master of science

Abstract:
Research shows that there are promising system developments for the construction industry, but that the sector is slow in adapting new technologies, due to a number of perceived barriers. The purpose of this study is to determine if the improvements can be made to the systems deployed during Dutch public-private construction projects, to increase the communication between stakeholders. The aim is to understand the specific barriers of stakeholders in Dutch public-private construction projects, and determine whether these can be solved by system improvements. The study makes use of semi-structured interviews with project overseers from both the public and private sides. The results of the study are a set of requirements for systems improvements, and considerations about standardization and knowledge retention in the industry. The study concluded that the current systems are underutilised, and that improvements can be made in BIM-maturity, knowledge retention, and information exchange, as well as more standardized communication.


The codes for the sub-questions are found in the map 'sub-question code trees'. Unfortunately, I could not export them as anything other than an excel file, which is included as 'Code Document'. Here you can find how I grouped the codes, but is somewhat messy. I could not make it work any other way without having to start over, which I did not have the time to do before the deadline.
